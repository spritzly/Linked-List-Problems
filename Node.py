This is the basis for other files used in data structure/OOP practice files,
sorta like a template so I don't have to write this shit over and over again.
If neeeded, I will import the Node class from this file onto the file I will be
currently working on :)

class Node:
  def __init__(self, value, next_node=None, prev_node=None):
    self.value = value
    self.next_node = next_node
    self.prev_node = prev_node
    
  def set_next_node(self, next_node):
    self.next_node = next_node
    
  def get_next_node(self):
    return self.next_node

  def set_prev_node(self, prev_node):
    self.prev_node = prev_node
    
  def get_prev_node(self):
    return self.prev_node
